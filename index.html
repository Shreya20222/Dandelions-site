<p style="text-align: center;"><b>She loved like a nature's roaring waterfall, her hair was golden brown, and her smile was so soothing and calming, and she walked without the fear of the future because she knew God was on her side.</b></p>

<h2 style="background-color:pink; text-align:center;">This is my story</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">The battles I have faced with the help of God, when most times I didn't even know that I was safe in His presence, He lifted me and guided me through the wilderness. He rescued me, even when I was rejecting Him and blaming Him for all that had happened. Sadly, I can't tell anyone what I am going through because I cannot trust them. I have been safe ears and given them a safe place, but not one person was there for me to defend me when I was at my worst..</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>God is in this Story</b></p>
<blockquote cite="https://shreya20222.github.io/Dandelions-site/">
For 23 years, she has worked hard towards her goals, caring and helping others at the same time, though she wasn't perfect, which gave her obvious reason to fall apart and develop habits that slowly destroyed her. Despite all the things she has faced, her beauty and light, which she carried from God, did not fade. Music was one of the ways she felt that brought her closer to God. people saw her strength and grace, but never realized she was a victim of this cruel world. Little did she know that her life was going to change completely.
