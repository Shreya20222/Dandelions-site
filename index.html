<p style="text-align: center;"><b>She loved like a nature's roaring waterfall, her hair was golden brown, and her smile was so soothing and calming, and she walked without the fear of the future because she knew God was on her side.</b></p>

<h2 style="background-color:pink; text-align:center;">This is my story</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">The battles I have faced with the help of God, when most times I didn't even know that I was safe in His presence, He lifted me and guided me through the wilderness. He rescued me, even when I was rejecting Him and blaming Him for all that had happened. Sadly, I can't tell anyone what I am going through because I cannot trust them. I have been safe ears and given them a safe place, but not one person was there for me to defend me when I was at my worst..</p>

<h2 style="background-color:pink; text-align:center;"><b>God is in this Story</b></h2>
<blockquote cite="https://shreya20222.github.io/Dandelions-site/">
For 23 years, she had worked hard towards her goals, caring for and helping others at the same time. Although she wasn't perfect, this gave her obvious reasons to fall apart and develop habits that slowly destroyed her. Despite all the things she has faced, her beauty and light, which she carried from God, did not fade. Music was one of the ways she felt that brought her closer to God. people saw her strength and grace, but never realized she was a victim of this cruel world. Little did she know that her life was going to change completely.

<p style="text-align: center;">She always dreamed of becoming a singer or an artist, and she often tried to write songs and books whenever she was alone; her imagination was way ahead of her time. The knowledge she gained from school, what she watched, everything shaped her into who she is now at 27 years old. yes, I was 27 when I started writing this book. I was so naive and trusting that it led me to make my best and poor choices, and sometimes turned me into either a good human being or a bad person. it is important to understand why God forgives and accepts sinners with love and joy as they return to him. The devil is no joke, and the purest and kindest of souls are prone to be his victims, and he gives us authority over all demons and the devil. The purpose of this book is to document my life's journey and to let people know that God is real. When you let Him do His work through you, you come to understand the true meaning of life. Now, I understand why God let me pursue computers because today's generation has to see it through the internet. It was already written that every knee shall bow, and everyone must hear and know that Jesus Christ is our Savior. I am honored and excited to see how this goes. </p>

  <h5 style="background-color:pink; text-align:center;">God Found Her And Never Left Her Side</h5>


  <p style= text-align: center;" >How she got closer to God is something that should be taken into our brains and hearts, as she didn't just follow him blindly, she understood what God is and how much he loved this world that he gave his only son. One day she happened to go to church for good friday, and they happened to play Passion of Christ for kids to see at their sundays school and she didnt even realize that she was crying because she experienced christ for the first time she happened to see a lot of movies but this movie had her heart like it was the last thing she would remeber at the end of her life. What God did for her and the world. She was only taught to believe it was god who created us, but after seeing how he was betrayed, she just knew because that's what you do when you love someone dearly, you would die for them to save them. It was at a very young age that she understood the meaning of love through her creator, and since then, he has never left her side, no matter how bad the devil tried to attack her.</p>
  <p style= text-align: center;">Even if I lose this battle, even if I have to lose everyone and everything, even when the devil attacks me again to make me lose my faith in God, I believe that he will always bring me back to him and give me more than what I have lost. </p>
